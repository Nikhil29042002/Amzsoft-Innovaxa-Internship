1. Write a simple "Hello, World!" program:

print("Hello, World!")

2. Learn about Python variables, data types, and basic operations:

a. Python Variables: In Python, you can create variables to store data. Variables don't require explicit declaration; you simply assign a value to them.
 For example:

my_variable = 42

b. Data Types: Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, and more.
 For example:

my_integer = 42
my_float = 3.14
my_string = "Hello, Python!"
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
c. Basic Operations: Python allows you to perform basic operations on variables, such as arithmetic operations on numbers, concatenation of strings, and more. 

For example:

result = 10 + 5  # Addition
message = "Hello, " + "World!"  # String concatenation


3. Implement control structures like loops and conditional statements:

a. Loops: Python supports both for and while loops for iterating over sequences or executing code repeatedly. 
For example:

# Using a for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Using a while loop
num = 0
while num < 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1
b. Conditional Statements: Python uses if, elif, and else statements for conditional execution. 

For example:

x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
